# Deep Learning Repository

Welcome to my Deep Learning Repository!

## About
This repository is dedicated to my journey in learning deep learning. I'm excited to dive into the world of neural networks, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. As I progress in my studies, I'll be uploading new content, including code, projects, and resources related to deep learning.

## Getting Started
If you're new to deep learning or want to explore further, feel free to check out the resources and projects in this repository.

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed to run the code and projects.

## Projects
Stay tuned for upcoming projects! As I progress in my learning journey, I'll be working on various deep learning projects and sharing them here.

- **Supervised Folder**: Inside the repository, you can find a folder named "Supervised" where you'll discover examples of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

## Resources
I'll be curating a list of useful resources, including tutorials, articles, books, and online courses, to help you get started or enhance your understanding of deep learning concepts.

## Contributing
If you're interested in contributing to this repository or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!

Happy coding!
